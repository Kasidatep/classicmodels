            The Emergence of a new Cult in Society - Classic Cars as Status Symbols
            In 1885, Carl Benz turned over a new leaf in the history of mobility and was granted a patent for the first
            automobile. The technique evolved with new makes and models like the Ford Tin Lizzie and the Mercedes-Benz
            300
            SL over the past 100 years. Some of the tedious models from the past turned into popular classic Car models
            over
            the years - European cars like the Volkswagen Beetle, Citroen 2CV or Jaguar XK and other "oldies" are good
            examples for this nostalgic value.
            Over 2.500 manufacturers produced a countless number of different car models over the past 100 years. It is
            not
            that easy to tell what makes a certain car so special, even decades after the production shut down.
            Sometimes it
            depends on the car body as such, sometimes a famous driver increased the popularity of a certain car model.
            Good
            examples for cars that made an astonishing image change are the European Opel Kadett or classic muscle cars
            from
            the US. Those pragmatic but fuel consuming cars were widely disliked for years - today, there is a huge fan
            community for old and restored muscle cars and standard models from Europe and they are popular collectibles
            for
            every automobile fan.
